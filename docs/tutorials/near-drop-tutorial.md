# Building Token Drop Systems on NEAR

Token drops are a powerful mechanism for distributing cryptocurrencies and digital assets to users without requiring them to have existing accounts or technical knowledge. On NEAR Protocol, drops leverage unique features like Function Call keys to create seamless onboarding experiences that feel familiar to Web2 users.

This tutorial will teach you how to build a complete token drop system, covering the concepts, implementation strategies, and best practices for creating user-friendly token distribution mechanisms.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding token drops and their real-world use cases
- Leveraging NEAR's unique Function Call keys for gasless transactions  
- Implementing drops for different token types (NEAR, FT, NFT)
- Security considerations and best practices
- Testing and deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of smart contracts
- Familiarity with NEAR Protocol concepts
- Rust programming knowledge (helpful but not required)

---

## Understanding Token Drops

### The Traditional Problem

Traditional cryptocurrency transactions create barriers for new users:
- Recipients must have existing blockchain accounts
- Users need to understand wallet mechanics and seed phrases
- Gas fees create friction for small transactions
- Technical knowledge requirements exclude mainstream adoption

### The NEAR Solution

NEAR Drops eliminate these barriers by creating a Web2-like experience:
- **Gasless Claims**: Users don't need NEAR tokens to claim drops
- **Account Creation**: New accounts are created automatically during claiming
- **Secure Links**: Private keys embedded in shareable links enable easy distribution
- **Multiple Token Types**: Support for NEAR tokens, fungible tokens, and NFTs

This approach enables use cases like conference attendee rewards, marketing campaigns, and user onboarding programs that would be impractical with traditional blockchain interactions.

## Core Concepts

### Function Call Keys: The Secret Sauce

NEAR's Function Call keys are restricted access keys that can only call specific methods on specific contracts. Unlike full access keys, they provide:

- **Limited Scope**: Can only execute predetermined contract methods
- **Security**: No risk of account takeover or unauthorized transactions  
- **Gasless Execution**: The contract account pays for gas, not the key holder
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Keys can be removed after use to maintain security

### Drop Lifecycle

Understanding the complete flow helps you design better drop experiences:

1. **Drop Creation**: Creator deposits tokens and generates unique key pairs
2. **Key Registration**: Public keys are added to the contract as Function Call keys
3. **Link Generation**: Private keys are encoded into shareable URLs
4. **Distribution**: Links are shared via email, QR codes, or social media
5. **Claiming**: Recipients use links to claim tokens (with or without existing accounts)
6. **Cleanup**: Exhausted drops are removed to optimize storage costs

---

## Types of Token Drops

### NEAR Token Drops

Direct distribution of NEAR's native cryptocurrency, ideal for:
- **User Onboarding**: Give new users their first NEAR tokens
- **Event Rewards**: Conference attendees, workshop participants
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Social media engagement rewards

**Key Considerations:**
- Account creation requires minimum balance (~0.1 NEAR)
- Consider drop amounts that enable meaningful transactions
- Plan for storage costs when creating many drops

### Fungible Token (FT) Drops  

Custom token distribution following the NEP-141 standard:
- **Loyalty Programs**: Points, rewards, membership tokens
- **Governance Tokens**: DAO participation rights
- **Utility Tokens**: Access to services or features

**Implementation Notes:**
- Requires integration with existing FT contracts
- Verify token contract compatibility before deployment
- Consider token economics and total supply implications

### Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Drops

Unique digital asset distribution for:
- **Collectibles**: Digital art, trading cards, memorabilia  
- **Access Tokens**: Event tickets, membership badges
- **Certificates**: Course completion, achievement recognition

**Special Considerations:**
- Each NFT drop is unique and one-time use
- Metadata and royalty considerations
- Integration with NFT marketplaces

---

## Implementation Architecture

### Contract State Management

The drop contract efficiently manages three critical data structures:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
       url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
       start="22" end="29" />

**Key Design Decisions:**
- `drop_id_by_key` enables O(1) lookup during claiming
- `drop_by_id` stores minimal data to reduce storage costs  
- `next_drop_id` provides unique identifiers without collisions

### Security Model

The contract implements defense-in-depth security:

**Access Control**: Function Call keys can only execute claim methods
**Input Validation**: All parameters are sanitized and validated
**State Consistency**: Atomic operations prevent partial state updates
**Resource Management**: Storage costs are calculated and charged upfront

### Drop Types Implementation

<Language value="rust" language="rust">
<Github fname="drop_types.rs"
   url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/drop_types.rs"
   start="8" end="16" />
</Language>

Each drop type encapsulates its specific requirements while sharing common claiming logic.

## Creating Drops: Best Practices

### Planning Your Drop Strategy

Before implementation, consider:

**Audience**: Who are your recipients? Existing crypto users or newcomers?
**Distribution Method**: Email links, QR codes, or social media?
**Timing**: Immediate claiming or time-delayed campaigns?
**Scale**: Individual drops or mass distribution?

### Storage Cost Optimization

Drop creation involves three types of storage costs:

1. **Drop Data Storage**: The actual drop information (amount, type, etc.)
2. **Key Mapping Storage**: PublicKey â†’ DropId relationships  
3. **Access Key Storage**: Adding keys to the contract account

## Claiming Process: User Experience Design

### Two Claiming Paths

The contract supports both existing and new users:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="existing" label="Existing Account">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="claim_for"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="11" end="14" />
      <Github fname="internal_claim"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="58" end="85" />
    </Language>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="new" label="New Account">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="create_account_and_claim"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="16" end="41" />
    </Language>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

Design your claiming interface to handle:
- **Invalid Keys**: Clear error messages for expired or invalid links
- **Already Claimed**: Informative feedback when drops are exhausted  
- **Account Name Conflicts**: Alternative suggestions for new account creation
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic and offline capability
